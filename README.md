## Speak my dears üòä, Welcome to my github, I am Wellington Silva.. 


My name is Wellington Silva Santos, I have a degree in Information Systems from the Federal University of Par√° and I have significant experience in the development area, both full stack and solid knowledge in data analysis. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work in several areas of technology, which has given me a broad and practical vision of developing efficient and robust solutions.

I worked as an intern at Serpro, where I developed low-code skills, created solutions using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python, and actively participated in organizing backlogs and prioritizing tasks, collaborating directly with the team to improve project efficiency. In addition, I had the opportunity to work with databases, performing insertions and queries in MSQL, which gave me a solid foundation in DBA and data management.

I also worked at the Federal University of Par√°, improving my skills with the Joomla content management system, in addition to contributing to the design and development of websites, which strengthened my knowledge in content management and systems development.

My experience in bioinformatics has given me a solid foundation in complex data analysis, which I believe will be a valuable asset for the challenges presented in the position, especially if they involve processing and interpreting large volumes of information.

With my combination of technical skills, hands-on experience in data development and analysis, and the ability to work as part of a team and solve problems, I believe I can contribute significantly to the success of the company. I am always seeking to improve and willing to take on new challenges, which is why I am applying for this position.
